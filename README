Our project makes use of Qt libraries.
In order to install Qt, run:
	sudo apt-get install qt

Once you have Qt, compile the project by running:
	qmake
and then:
	make

This creates the Makefile for you.
Once the project is compiled, you start it by doing:
	./RPG

From there, follow the instructions to play the Tower RPG game!
