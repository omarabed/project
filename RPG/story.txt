:Intro:
Urghh... Ow, my head. What happened?
It's so dark in here.
HELLO!... Hello... hellooo...
I can't remember anything.
Where am I?
WHO am I?
:Character made:
It's coming back... Slowly.
Stone walls... an echo...
I'm in some tower.
What's that, in the shadows?

:First enemy:
What the heck was that?!
Okay, new goal. Just try not to get killed.
And in the meantime, look for some stairs. Maybe on a higher level I can find a window or something and get some help.
